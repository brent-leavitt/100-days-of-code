# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created two GitHub Repos! Continued working on localhost version of updated NB_doula_course plugin. 

**Thoughts:** Today really felt more like organization than actual coding work. I'm recommitting myself to the #100DaysOfCode challenge to get at least one hour of code in each day.

**Questions/Issues for Research:** 
* I need to study code on how to add custome Capabilities and Roles to wordpress programatically. I have been using a plugin to setup capabilities for our user database.

### Day 2: February 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started into adding Custom Roles and Caps to my doula course plugin. 

**Thoughts**: Turns out working with and adding Roles in Caps in wordpress is super-easy programmatically. There will be more to do here tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
