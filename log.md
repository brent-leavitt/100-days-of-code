# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created two GitHub Repos! Continued working on localhost version of updated NB_doula_course plugin. 

**Thoughts:** Today really felt more like organization than actual coding work. I'm recommitting myself to the #100DaysOfCode challenge to get at least one hour of code in each day.

**Questions/Issues for Research:** 
* I need to study code on how to add custome Capabilities and Roles to wordpress programatically. I have been using a plugin to setup capabilities for our user database.

### Day 2: February 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started into adding Custom Roles and Caps to my doula course plugin. 

**Thoughts**: Turns out working with and adding Roles in Caps in wordpress is super-easy programmatically. There will be more to do here tomorrow. 



### Day 3: Thursday, February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started off elsewhere and then spent some time looking into how users are managed in WordPress Multisite. Not really any actual coding, more just studying of existing structures. 

**Thoughts** I'm surprised at how little documentation there actually is about how users are managed in multisites. 



### Day 4: Friday, February 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started work into a user management plugin for a wordpress multisite. 

**Thoughts** There's really very little documentation about working with users in the Multisite environment. It's kind of lonely territory. Spent a lot of time in Wordpress core files today. Crazy how many filters there out there. 

**Questions/Issues for Research:** 
* Looking for insights in to how to manage different sites dynamically from the code base.
